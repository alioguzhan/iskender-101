# Iskender-101 [^1]

## Purpose

For years, I’ve been frequently asked this question. Each time, I used to give similar answers to friends and acquaintances. I decided to write it down properly and keep it on GitHub. Anyone can check it whenever they want.

## Places

All the following places serve Iskender[^1] kebabs that are at least 8/10 in quality. While taste is subjective, it’s hard to leave any of these places without enjoying the food. The taste differences among them are at most 10-15%. However, there are other criteria to consider when choosing a place. Here are the options:

1. If you don’t mind waiting in line and being in a small, not-so-comfortable place, as long as you can enjoy the authentic Iskender in its historic original location: [Mavi Dukkan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Auvuk6M2W6nXPL1b7)
2. If you prefer the original owners but in a more spacious and comfortable setting, where you can enjoy dessert, tea, etc.: [Iskender Efendi Konagi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dEitiL2nE4StnZ3P9)
3. A place that’s as delicious as the original owners' spots, recommended by Vedat Milor, though you'll have to wait in line in this small establishment: [Uludag Kebabcisi - Cemal Cemil Usta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GmbwLhRS4SXoUmPM8)
4. A historic and famous spot not associated with the original owners but still very delicious, at least as good as the original place: [Bursa Kebabcisi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tUHBGNc6dbdqknK49)
5. Editor’s Bonus:

   - I've been to Bursa before and have had Iskender at the original place, I'm open to alternatives.
   - I haven't been to Bursa before but are not too concerned about the exact place, I just want a great Iskender.
   - I don't want to be met with 5/10 hospitality to have a 10/10 Iskender. The Iskender should be at least 8/10, but so should the service.[^2]
   - I want a good Iskender, but the prices should be reasonable. I don't want my wallet to suffer just because I'm eating at the original place.

If any of these criteria fit, there is an alternative to the above options: [Ulu Hunkar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iEWLSC6XpzVXvE4b9)

## Decision-Making Guide

- If it's your first time visiting and you won't be coming back to Bursa for a long time, choose either `1` or `2`, as these are the places with the original owners.
- If you're a fan of Vedat Milor and would follow his recommendation anywhere, try the `3` option. It’s genuinely good, but it's small and you'll have to wait in line.
- Be prepared for long waits at `1` and `3`, especially on weekends.
- If you’ve been to Bursa before or will return, and you don’t want to wait in the heat or cold, `2` and `4` are ideal.
- If you don’t want to make a big deal out of it and just want to eat your Iskender quietly without the hassle: go for the `5` option.
- If you'd like to explore historic Bursa after your meal, such as visiting Koza Han or Ulu Camii, both `1` and `4` are in the city center and within walking distance of these sites.
